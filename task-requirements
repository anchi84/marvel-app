The goal of this assignment is to create an application that will allow users to search and bookmark their
favorites Marvel characters. You should query the marvel API to search for characters
(https://developer.marvel.com/). If youâ€™re uncertain about any details of the project, feel free to render
your own decisions.

Functional Requirements
- There should be no button to instantiate the search instead the search should be run and result
displayed while the user is interacting with the search input.
- Search result item can be bookmarked by the user, the bookmarked search item should be saved
in the user local storage and displayed when the search input is empty.
- Should limit to 20 result from the API Optional: Use pagination to allow user to
navigate through all the results.
- The characters should be displayed in a 4x5 Grid on Desktop, 2x10 Grid on Tablet, 1x20 Grid on
Mobile.
- Each item in the grid should display the image, name and bookmarked state of the character.
- The image size may vary, but make sure the grid accommodates any image size and displays
consistently, still keeping it responsive. Avoid stretching or squeezing the image instead scale
and align it in the center. No white space should appear on the sides but the image can be
cropped.
Requirements
- Use React library or Vanilla JS.
- Styling should be written from scratch.
- Ensure that the elements work and display correctly in the latest versions of all modern
browsers.
Project Delivery
Create and provide access to a private repo on Gitlab/BitBucket/Github or send us the zip archive with
the source code (should include instructions on how to run the application + a description of your
solution where you explain your decisions, assumptions or limitations of the application).
